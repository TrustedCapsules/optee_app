How to install protobuf-c and run example code:

1) clone google's protobuf (C++) from source: https://github.com/google/protobuf.git
2) follow the README.md in protobuf /src directory to install Protocol Buffer runtime 
   and the Protocol Buffer compiler
   
   OPTIONAL: there are examples in /examples directory and on 
             https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/cpptutorial

3) clone protobuf-c from source: https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c.git
4) install protobuf-c (if permission issues are encountered, use sudo):
	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make 
	make install
	
5) the Protocol Buffer API consists of two generated files amessage.pb-c.c 
   and amessage.pb-c.h. These files are generated from the protobuf specification
   defined in amessage.proto:

   protoc-c --c_out=. amessage.proto

   Replace #include<protobuf-c/protobuf-c.h> in amessage.pb-c.h with #include "protobuf-c.h"
